# Data for the PhD project titled "Sequencing the North Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) genome and development of a genetic stock management tool"

# A1 was assembled with only the Illumina data, using the de Bruijn graph assembler AllPaths-LG v52488.
# A1 = Ch.A1.fa.gz
# A2 was generated by closing gaps in A1 using GapFiller v1.10 software and scaffolded with four runs of MinION reads using the SSPACE-LongRead v1.1 software. A second scaffolding step was performed using the linked reads and ARCS v1.0.5.
# A2 = Ch.A2.fa.gz
